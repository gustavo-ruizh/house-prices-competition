# House prices competition

This is my latest entry in the ongoing House Prices competition at Kaggle, which is currently ranked in the Top 25%.

Some sections of the code were commented out (e.g., feature selection through different methods), as they were found to add no value to the regression models but could be explored further at a later time.
